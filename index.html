            <h2>Why get involved?</h2>
            <p>Some motivations for contributing to <abbr title="Open-source software">OSS</abbr>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You want to save yourself time in the future (i.e.: only spend effort  fixing something once),</li>
              <li>You want to help others in the same situation,</li>
              <li>You got all this stuff for free, and now it is paying your bills, and now you feel like you should do something in return,</li>
              <li>You want to get your name out there (gain "community karma") to help you find work in the future,</li>
              <li>You want feedback from others (e.g.: for security),</li>
              <li>You want to be influential / a thought leader / establish an industry standard and gain competitive advantage / loyalty,</li>
              <li>You want to make the world a better place, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <small>Whatever your motivation(s), keep <a href="https://www.drupal.org/dcoc">Drupal's code of conduct</a> in mind!</small>
            <aside class="notes">
              Most of you probably wouldn't be listening to me talk if you didn't already know why you wanted to contribute to Drupal.<br />
              That being said, contributing to open-source software requires interacting with others in the community, and understanding some of the reasons that motivate them will help make things easier.<br />
              An important thing to note here is that people contribute to open-source software for reasons which range from fairly-selfish to fairly-altruistic, and many of these reasons lie somewhere in-between selfish and self-less.<br />
              I'm not going to judge you by your motivations for contributing.<br />
              Whatever your reasons are, keep in mind that Drupal has a code of conduct, which says: (1) "be considerate", (2) "be respectful", (3) "be collaborative", (4) "when we disagree, consult others", (5) "when unsure, ask for help", and (6) "step down considerately".

            <aside class="notes">
              I can't emphasize this enough: there is <em>way</em> more to contributing to Drupal than writing code.<br />
              A great way to support others is to come out to events like this one. I don't like public speaking but knowing there are people interested in something I know about was what motivated me to actually get up here. Plus, it's also encouraging to see the faces of my friends in the audience, to know I'm talking to friends instead of complete strangers.<br />
              If you are in a position of authority in your business, and your business uses Drupal, you can contribute by encouraging others to contribute. For example, while working on the MallDatabase website, I wrote little patches or modules that I didn't think would be useful to others, but my boss Diana encouraged me to contribute them.<br />
              Another great way to contribute is by organizing or volunteering at meetups, camps, conferences, etc. like this one. Even recording video is helpful, because it makes that talk accessible to others for years in the future.<br />
              Last I heard, Chris Luckhardt (the <abbr title="Drupal User Group Toronto">DUGTO</abbr> organizer) has been working with Drupal for 8(?) years, organizing DUGTO meetups, DrupalCamps Toronto, and now DrupalNorth, but doesn't yet have a patch in core. However, his work has helped the Drupal community in Toronto, Ontario, across Canada, and even in Japan grow significantly.<br />
              If you have a big address book, connecting other people can be incredibly helpful! If you know that someone is working on a problem and you know someone else who could help or has domain knowledge, introducing them to each-other will often result in a better result that gets done faster. It's easy for people working really hard on a problem to become siloed. At DrupalNorth, I met someone named Morgan Tocker who works on the team that builds and maintains MySQL, so when I heard about the next generation testbot initiative, I put the testbot maintainers in touch with him.<br />
              If you know how to use Drupal, demonstrating it to someone else, passing on your knowledge, and sharing tips helps to grow the community, empowers others, and helps you understand Drupal better. Brian Lewis started the Modules Unraveled podcast to help himself understand which modules to use, and it's turned into a career.<br />
              If you are good at writing or editing, then contribute to documentation! As a developer, I often struggle to write good documentation: having someone around to suggest better wording, organization, or point out mistakes is great. Drupal even has it's own Documentation Maintainer (Jennifer Hodgdon).<br />
              If you can speak other languages, you can also contribute by suggesting and voting on translations at localize.drupal.org. Also, most Drupal documentation is in US-English: writing documentation or blog posts in other languages really helps others who don't speak English as well as you do.<br />
              If you are a designer, or know anything about usability, Drupal core and many contributed modules could really use your input! A good way to start would be, if you see something that looks bad or is hard to use, file an issue, and suggest an alternative (along with your reasoning)!<br />
              If you are good at managing, prioritizing, and planning work, many contrib modules would love help managing their workload. That's what xjm does for Drupal core, and some of the bigger contrib projects, like Rules, has someone to do that too. At a higher level, the Drupal Association helps plan Drupal's long-term roadmap, identifying market trends and planning how to meet them, or identifying barriers to contribution and coming up with strategies to fix them.<br />
              If you are good at breaking things, writing or performing manual testing would be great. Also, Drupal's tests and testing infrastructure is constantly being improved, so your help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
              If you like Drupal and are good at marketing and/or graphic design, the Drupal Association has a Branding and Marketing Committee that could use your help promoting Drupal to the general public, putting together fact sheets, posters, templates, and other resources for people trying to sell Drupal to their bosses, sell their Drupal services to other companies, etc.<br />
              Finally, if you don't have the time to help yourself, donating to the Drupal Association helps pay for Drupal infrastructure, hosting, conferences, and ultimately contributes to Drupal's long-term success.

            <ul>
              <li>Volunteering?
                <ul>
                  <li>Volunteer when you have time.</li>
                  <li>Don't burn yourself out! If you run out of time/energy, that's okay: the community can (usually) pick up where you leave off.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="fragment">At work?
                <ul>
                  <li>Easier to sell boss/client on contributing bug fixes.</li>
                  <li>Developed something new?
                    <ul>
                      <li>Ask permission from your boss/client to contribute it.</li>
                      <li>Consider splitting some of the work on company time, some on your own time.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>

            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              There's no harm in asking your employer if they're willing to let you contribute on company time! Use some of the motivations from the previous slide!<br />
              If you developed something new, and your company / client paid you to do so, then you should ask their permission first. Otherwise, they might feel that you're taking something they paid money for and giving it to their competitors.<br />
              Some companies add clauses to their contracts to make it clear when the code they write could be contributed to the community. Some go as far as stating that all of the code they produce is a certain license.<br />
              Especially if you're new to contributing, doing some of the contribution work on your own time will help make yourself and your employer/client feel that less time is being wasted.<br />
              In my experience, the more contribution practice you get, the easier it gets to identify what can be contributed, and the more contribution time you can bill.

            <h3>Attributing your contributions</h3>
            <p>If you happen to be using the issue queue, Drupal.org has a feature to let you <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2451283">attribute your contributions</a> so you can say whether or not you are volunteering.<br /><img src="https://www.drupal.org/files/initial-comment-attribution.gif" alt="An animation of hestenet attributing a contribution to his employer, the Drupal Assocition, and his customer Tag1 Consulting." /></p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Not all of your contributions will be through the issue queue, but if you happen to be using it...<br />
              I suggest using the attribution features often! Tell others know if you're volunteering your time, and check whether others are volunteering before replying to them.<br />
              Note that the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> has been updated slightly since the GIF was recorded: there is now a separate checkbox to say "I'm volunteering my time" versus "I'm being paid by $employer to contribute for $customer."<br />
              If you make a mistake, you can edit a comment and change how it's attributed.
